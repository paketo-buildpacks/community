| Organization/Project | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/values/tech-at-bloomberg/open-source/projects/#developer-workflow) | Bloomberg uses Paketo-based buildpacks for its internal platforms.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [Doximity](https://technology.doximity.com/articles/buildpacks-vs-dockerfiles) | Doximity is extending Paketo stacks and using `ruby`, `go` and `nodejs` buildpacks as the foundation of their internal platform                                                                                        |
| [Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/reference/builders/#buildpacks) | Paketo is one of the buildpacks options that Fly users can select from in `flyctl`. An example using the Go buildpack is available in the [documentation](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/golang/#inside-fly-toml) | 
| [Greenhouse](https://github.com/grnhse) | Greenhouse uses the Paketo Python and NodeJS buildpacks to drive developer builds within our internal Platform as a Service. Switching to Paketo has been pretty seamless and saved us a ton of work. The support is great and we're able to supplement at times with small downstream buildpacks |
| [Knative](https://knative.dev/) | Paketo buildpacks serve as the default method of converting a Knative function into an OCI container for deployment. The [func CLI](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-func) uses the pack Go library to programatically invoke a build, potentially applying additional buildpacks when doing so. |
| [Porter](https://docs.porter.run/deploying-applications/deploying-from-github/selecting-application-and-build-method/#customizing-buildpacks)| Porter supports Paketo buildpacks as an option for users to build and deploy their applications on Kubernetes without having to manually containerize them                                                             |
