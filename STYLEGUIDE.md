# Style Guide

## Buildpack Design Best Practices
1. Keep `Detect` and `Build` functions as small as possible.
1. Only add a requirement to a buildpack if it's necessary for the buildpack to run.
1. Only add a provision to a buildpack if it actually supplies something for
   itself or a subsequent buildpack to use.

## Logging
1. A buildpack should, whenever possible, use logs to reveal how it is
   contributing to the build and launch environments. This includes actions like:
     - setting build/launch environment variables
     - installing dependencies
     - creating layers
1. If a buildpack invokes a tool that produces logs (e.g. `npm install`), it is
   preferred that the buildpack stream the logs (rather than
   buffering/swallowing them) to provide maximum visibility to users. The
   buildpack may adjust the verbosity of a tool's logs or apply formatting to
   them to improve the overall build logs' readability.

## Testing
1. Please write tests for your contributions to the Paketo project.
1. If your contribution changes or adds to the API of a buildpack, you'll
   likely need to change or add integration tests.
1. If your contribution changes how the `detect` or `build` executables of a
   buildpack work, you'll likely need to change or add unit tests.

## Preferred Code Structures
1. Many Paketo buildpacks are written in Go. If you are contributing Go, please
   write [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

1. When reviewing Pull Requests, maintainers may refer to these [Common Go Code
   Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).

1. If you're writing in a shell scripting language, keep [this Shell Style
   Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html) in mind.
   * In particular, check out the "When to use Shell" section to consider if
     it's time to switch languages.

## Stack choice

Most Paketo buildpacks can be divided into two categories - 

- Dependency/Distribution buildpacks like -
  [go-dist](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-dist),
  [node-engine](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine),
  [yarn](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/yarn),
  [dep](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/dep) etc. which provide tarball
  distributions which maybe architecture or linux distro specific.
- Configuration/Utility buildpacks like -
  [procfile](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/procfile),
  [environment-variables](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/environment-variables),
  [go-mod-vendor](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/go-mod-vendor),
  [npm-install](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/npm-install) etc. which
  use distribution buildpacks or are completely standalone.

1. Whenever possible, we should set the most permissive stack id for a
   buildpack. The Cloud Native Buildpack
   [spec](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/buildpack/0.5/buildpack.md#buildpack-implementations)
   allows for a wildcard stack `*` which indicates compatibility with any
   stack. 

1. The wildcard stack should be the stack of choice for utility or
   configuration buildpacks provided they can work on any linux stack. This
   should be the case for buildpacks written in `go` that are standalone and
   don't rely on any implicit stack dependencies.

1. If there are cases where a buildpack may work with any stack, but only under
   certain conditions, the buildpack should still indicate compatibility with
   any stack via the `*` stack id and dynamically validate the conditions it
   would properly execute in during its `detect` or `build` step with the aim
   being to fail as fast as possible if an incompatible environment is
   detected.

## Language Ecosystem Environment Variable Override

As per [Paketo RFC 0019](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs/blob/main/text/0019-buildpack-set-env-vars-defaults.md), buildpacks that configure environment variables that are recognized by
language-ecosystem tooling should set the `env.Default` option, not the
`env.Override` option at both build and launch. This will allow users to
configure the values of these environment variables.
