# Paketo Buildpacks community

Welcome to the Paketo Buildpacks community!

This document is an entry-point for contributing to the Paketo Buildpacks community.

## Governance
We make decisions as a group in a variety of public forums. Our governance practices are documented in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).



## Roadmap
Coming soon!



## Team
The list of project contributors and maintainers can be found in [TEAMS.md](TEAMS.md).



## Working Group Meetings

Working group meetings are a great place to more directly communicate with other members of the community. They tend to discuss active [RFCs](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs) and relay general project information.

These meetings occur bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 2pm EST/EDT.
