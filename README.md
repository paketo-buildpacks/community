## Team

## Working Group Meetings

Working group meetings are a great place to more directly communicate with other members of the community. They tend to discuss active [RFCs](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/rfcs) and relay general project information.

These meetings occur weekly on Tuesdays at 2pm EST/EDT.
